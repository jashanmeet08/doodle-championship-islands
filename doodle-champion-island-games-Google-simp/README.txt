This is an offline backup copy of the Doodle Champion Island Games by google and 4studios.

The game has been modified to forcefully load the english text and force fullscreen as well.

On Firefox, you can just open the kitsune20.html (you may have to change a setting for that though).
On Chromium and other web browsers, you will need to host your own HTTP server.
Do :
python3 -m http.server

On linux. You can also use Apache
